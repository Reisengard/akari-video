# AKARI Video Documentation

**Hand over your footage and it comes back edited. Open it, review it, fix only what matters.**

## Skills

The workflow ships as 26 agent-side skills. The [Skills Catalog](./skills.md) is the
single map: what each skill owns, when it triggers, and which external tools and
animation runtimes it connects to — including the two 3D paths.

## How-to

## Reference

Data contracts (schemas) and design documents. **This repository is the canonical source.**
All contracts follow the
[three versioning principles](./contract-2026-07-17-data-contract-versioning.md)
(mandatory version field, additive-only evolution, explicit migration).

> [!NOTE]
> Reference documents are currently Japanese-only. Open an issue if you need a
> specific contract in English.
